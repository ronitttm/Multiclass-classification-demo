In the realm of multiclass classification, the choice of strategy can significantly impact how a model handles multiple classes. Two common strategies are One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO). In this demonstration, we showcase the practical difference between these strategies using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The renowned Iris dataset, featuring three distinct classes of flowers—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—serves as our testing ground. We will explore how to implement both OvR and OvO strategies with scikit-learn's SVM, shedding light on their distinctive coding approaches and performance evaluations.
